# Single-threaded C++17 event bus.

This lib was inspired by https://github.com/gelldur/EventBus

I often need some kind of simple system of cross-coupling callbacks. Some kind of event bus system.
This is a cross-coupling from a call stack perspective.
And this is a decoupling system from an architectural point of view.

I had some eventbus implementations tailored to the place of use.
But after seeing Gelldurâ€™s eventbus, I realized that it was time to highlight such needs in one small and simple header.

It seemed reasonable to me to remove everything unnecessary from the project, everything that is not related to the task of systematizing callbacks.
Thus, for example, I transferred the responsibility of working with multithreading to the use side and abandoned any inter-threaded synchronization.

So this project is a compilation of ideas from various sources and partly from Gelldur's Eventbus.

## How attach it to your project
Just copy the eventbus.h header file to where you need it.

## How to use it

The API is pretty simple. There are only two entities that you need to know:
- `eventbus::EventBus` is a long-lived bus object that stores all references to active callbacks along with everything that was captured by lambdas, etc.
- `eventbus::Listener` is a manager for registering and removing callbacks.

**Step one:** create an event bus and place it somewhere where it will live long enough. Longer than all the callbacks registered in it.
```C++
auto bus = std::make_shared<eventbus::EventBus>();
```

**Step two:** create a listener object where you want to catch events. Then register a callback for the event using the `listen` method.
The listener object uses the RAII approach, so as long as the listener exists, it will be connected to the event bus and all callbacks registered with this listener will receive events from the event bus.
```C++
auto listener = eventbus::Listener(bus);
listener.listen<MyStateUpdate>([](const MyStateUpdate& e) {
    //we got the MyStateUpdate event
});
```
The event objects themselves do not require any special design. Usually these are simple structures that can be either empty structures or structures with some kind of payload.
It is only required that these objects be CopyConstructable.
Something like this:
```C++
struct RefreshRequired {};
struct MyStateUpdate { int payload; };
struct MessageReceived { std::string str; };
```

**Step three:** emit the event to the event bus.
To immediately start executing all callbacks associated with an event, use the `immediate` method.
```C++
bus->immediate(MyStateUpdate{ 123 });
```
To prepare one or more events and emit them later, use a combination of the `post` and `process` methods.
```C++
bus->post(MessageReceived{ "hello" });
bus->post(MessageReceived{ "world" });
bus->process();
```
Inside the `process` method there is a loop with `immediate` for all events previously prepared with `post`.

*TODO: describe the warning about capturing `this` in lambda callback - the captured object can not be moved because its address has been captured (obviously) and stored in long-life storage in the eventbus system.*

Here are some examples of use.

```C++
#include "eventbus.h"

#include <string>
#include <cassert>

void example1()
{
    struct MyStateUpdate { int payload; };

    auto bus = std::make_shared<eventbus::EventBus>();

    {
        auto listener = eventbus::Listener(bus);

        listener.listen<MyStateUpdate>([](const MyStateUpdate& e) {
            assert(e.payload == 123);
        });

        bus->immediate(MyStateUpdate{ 123 });
    }
}

void example2()
{
    struct MessageReceived { std::string str; };

    auto bus = std::make_shared<eventbus::EventBus>();

    {
        auto listener = eventbus::Listener(bus);

        int eventsCount = 0;
        listener.listen<MessageReceived>([&eventsCount](const MessageReceived& e) {
            assert(
                (eventsCount == 0 && e.str == "hello") || 
                (eventsCount == 1 && e.str == "world")
            );
            ++eventsCount;
        });

        bus->post(MessageReceived{ "hello" });
        bus->post(MessageReceived{ "world" });
        bus->process();

        assert(eventsCount == 2);
    }
}

void example3()
{
    struct MyStateUpdate { int payload; };
    struct MessageReceived { std::string str; };

    auto bus = std::make_shared<eventbus::EventBus>();

    {
        auto listener = eventbus::Listener(bus);

        listener.listen<MyStateUpdate>([](const MyStateUpdate& e) {
            assert(e.payload == 123);
        });

        int messagesCount = 0;
        listener.listen<MessageReceived>([&messagesCount](const MessageReceived& e) {
            assert(
                (messagesCount == 0 && e.str == "hello") ||
                (messagesCount == 1 && e.str == "world")
            );
            ++messagesCount;
        });

        bus->immediate(MyStateUpdate{ 123 });

        bus->post(MessageReceived{ "hello" });
        bus->post(MessageReceived{ "world" });
        bus->process();

        assert(messagesCount == 2);
    }
